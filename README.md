# Changes-in-Life-Expectancy-by-Country-1952-2007-
An RShiny application showcasing changes in life expectancy by birth per country within the timeframe 1952-2007 using data from the `gapminder` package in R.

## I. Description
This RShiny dashboard (pictured below) allows the user to look at life expectancy rates at birth among different countries and how much they've changed from one year to another.  The data on life expectancy rates is plotted as an adjustable dumbbell plot where both ends of each dumbbell plotted represent data points for life expectancy rates at different years for a given country.

Using the Filter toolbar to the left of the dashboard, the user can select the two years in which life expectancy data is obtained, the continents to get a list of countries from, and which countries to display data for on this dumbbell plot (with a maximum of 15 countries that can be plotted at once).

For example, in this dashboard below, it's been adjusted to showcase changes in life expectancy for the selected and plotted countries `Bahrain`, `Chad`, `China`, `Egypt`, and `Indonesia` from the year 1962 (indicated by red-colored points) to the year 1987 (indicated on the graph as blue-colored points).  The red and blue points respectively show values for life expectancy at birth for those countries in 1962 and 1987 respectively with a grey line connecting the two together.
